## What is this?

This project aims to gather useful tools to work in the terminal like a **true lord of terminals** 🏰:

- Scripts to configure your terminal environment.  
- Themes, colors, and wallpapers to personalize your terminal.  
- Automations to speed up your workflow.

---

## Technologies / Tools

- **Shell Scripts (Bash)**  
- Compatible with:  
  - Linux  
- Supported terminals:  
  - bash  
  - zsh  
  - any ANSI-compatible terminal

---

## Installation & Quick Start

1. **Install available updates**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Clone the repository and navigate to it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sweetlord16/lordofterminals.git
cd lordofterminals
```
Grant execution permissions to the script

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

Execute the script

```bash
./setup.sh
```
After the script finishes you will be prompted to restart your system. Once rebooted, select bspwm as your window manager and log in.

This script (`setup.sh`) will configure everything needed for your terminal environment and apply the **default** automatically.
